# App ToDo

The main goal of this project is to facilitate task management through a simple and intuitive interface. 

This application uses **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** on the frontend, and **Java with Spring Boot** on the backend. It allows users to **create, read, update, and delete** tasks (CRUD), providing a practical way to keep track of their to-do items.

## ‚ú® Features
- List all available tasks.
- Add a new task.
- Update task.
- Delete task from the database.
- Search and order task by its information.

## Update README - New Scope

The project has undergone a slight change in scope. Now, each task is associated with a specific sector of the company, helping to ensure a more robust and organized management system. This association allows for better categorization and prioritization of tasks, ultimately enhancing overall productivity.

## Methodology
This project follows the agile methodology, using **Kanban** for task management.
