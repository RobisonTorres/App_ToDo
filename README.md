# App ToDo

The main goal of this project is to facilitate task management through a simple and intuitive interface. 

This application uses **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** on the frontend, and **Java with Spring Boot** on the backend. It allows users to **create, read, update, and delete** tasks (CRUD), providing a practical way to keep track of their to-do items.
